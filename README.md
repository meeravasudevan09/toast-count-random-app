## Toast, Count and Random App

A simple kotlin app to explore layouts and creating more than one activity.

This app will have the following three functions:

1. Toast - will display a small popup message on pressing this button (toasts do not interfere/interact with the app itself and will run independently until it disappears after a certain pre-defined timeout)

2. Count - will increment the given number by 1

3. Random - will display a random number between 0 and the current Count value
